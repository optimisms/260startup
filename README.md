# SPCA Forms/Payment/Queue screens

## Description deliverable

### Elevator pitch

My mom is the president of our local SPCA, a non-profit dedicated to animal welfare. Like many non-profits, they are signicantly behind in technology because they simply lack have the funds to pay someone to create custom software or webpages for them. For example, at every event, all patrons must stand in line to fill out a paper form, then stand in another line to pay at a physical credit card machine or cash box, and then wait around for someone to call out their name. The organization pays for these paper forms to be printed (300 forms almost every week), and then they save them for multiple years for tax and grant purposes. There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of forms in my house and my mom can never find the ones she needs. All of this could be simplified with a few webpages: an online form that saves to a searchable database of customers and pets, an online payment option, and a live queue that notifies customers when they're next in line.
