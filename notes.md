### Notes:
9/12 - I've already used GitHub a lot in the past so most of this was not new, but the GitLens feature on VSCode is very interesting and useful. It's similar to IntelliJ's GitHub features.

10/1 - If connecting to a new AWS EC2 instance isn't working, make sure you're using http and not https.
